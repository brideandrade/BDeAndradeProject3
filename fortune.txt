Delight the world with compassion, kindness and grace
The early bird gets the worm
You think it’s a secret, but they know.
The fortune you seek is in another cookie.
Be on the alert to recognize your prime at whatever time of your life it may occur.
Your reality check is about to bounce.
Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.
When blind leading the blind...get out of the way.
Everyone seems normal until you get to know them.
The real kindness comes from within you.
Experience is what you have left when everything else gone.
A closed mouth gathers no feet.
A conclusion is simply the place where you got tired of thinking.
A cynic is only a frustrated optimist.
A foolish man listens to his heart. A wise man listens to cookies.
Your road to glory will be rocky but fulfilling.
Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point.
Patience is your alley at the moment. Don’t worry!
Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.
Don’t worry about money. The best things in life are free.
